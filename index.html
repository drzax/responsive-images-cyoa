						<p>A while back I had to choose a technique to implement responsive images, and this was my approach.</p>
						<p>First, I did a survey of all the usual places, dug up as much info as I could about the current state of play and how others were implementing it in practice. </p>
						<p>It quickly became clear that there wasn't a good solution, much less a single solution people were beginning to settle on. In fact, there seemed to be ongoing arguments about the ultimate approach and a lot of required functionality was (and is) simply missing from browsers. On top of that, there were an awful lot of techniques being proposed and they all had significant drawbacks of one type of another. The best technique would depend heavily on your specific requirements.</p>

						<h1>Extra markup</h1>
						<div class="content">
							<div class="flip">
								<div class="front">
									<p>This issue is really one of practicality and can be especially important if 
									there is significant archive content or unskilled users will be managing the site.</p>
									<h2>Key considerations</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Would it be impractical to update existing <code>&lt;img></code> tags?</li>
										<li>Do the content producers have the technical ability to implement and maintain specific markup?</li>
										<li>Is extra markup okay if the technique or site design is changed in the future?</li>
										<li>What are the accessibility implications?</li>
									</ul>
								</div>
								<div class="back">
									<p>Most techniques for implementing responsive images utilse some kind of specific markup
									in or around each image tag. This can be anything from additional attributes on the <code>&lt;img></code>
									tag itself to completely custom and non-standard markup which only uses an <code>&lt;img></code>
									tag as a fallback.</p>
									<p>Relying on specific markup can be problematic for a variety of reasons.</p>
									<h3>Legacy content</h3>
									<p>If there is a large amount of legacy content, going back and implementing the new responsive
									technique around all images may be a non-trivial exercise. Even if there is a large amount of 
									legacy content, it may not be important that it gets updated. Maybe the majority of visitors
									to the site only see content and ignoring archived content is a compromise worth making.</p>
									<h3>Future content</h3>
									<p>Another important consideration is future content. Many sites are managed by non-technical 
									users and ensuring that each image tag has the required specific markup might not be possible.
									Maybe the site's CMS has a WYSIWYG editor which authors use to insert images; can it be adapted
									to ensure that every image is inserted with the required markup?</p>
									<h3>Future design</h3>
									<p>If the site's design is updated in the future, will the additional markup for each image
									be problematic?</p>
